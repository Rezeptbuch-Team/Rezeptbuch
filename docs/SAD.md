### 1.5 Overview
This document outlines the architecture of Rezeptbuch, covering the purpose, key goals,
architectural representation, and views (Use-Case, Logical, Process, Deployment, and Implementation).
It also addresses size, performance, and quality considerations.

## 2. Architectural Represantation
The archtiecture is split into API, ApplicationLogic and Application.
Where ApplicationLogic and Application are working closely together and the API is being accessed by the ApplicationLogic through HTTP-Endpoints.

## 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints
The architecture of Rezeptbuch is shaped by Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASR)
that define the system's quality attributes and constraints.
These requirements address critical aspects such as performance, testability, maintainability,
usability and scalability.

For a detailed overview of the ASR and the associated architectural decisions,
refer to the [ASR document](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/ASR.md).


## 4. Use-Case-View
Below is the Use Case Diagram for Rezeptbuch, which provides a visual representation of the system’s core use cases
and the interactions between actors and the system:

![Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UseCaseDiagram.png)

Below is the list of key use cases for Rezeptbuch, each detailing a specific interaction between the user and the system:
- [Show recipe](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UseCases/UC1_ShowRecipe.md)  
   Displays detailed information about a specific recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and related metadata.
- [Navigate through recipe](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UseCases/UC2_NavigateThroughRecipe.md)  
   Guides the user step-by-step through the cooking process with the option to adjust servings before starting.
- [List local recipes](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UseCases/UC3_ListLocalRecipes.md)  
   Provides a list of locally saved recipes with filtering, sorting, and searching capabilities.
- [List online recipes](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UseCases/UC4_ListOnlineRecipes.md)  
   Fetches and displays a list of online recipes with options for filtering and sorting.
- [Create recipe](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UseCases/UC5_CreateRecipe.md)  
   Allows users to create and save a new recipe with details such as title, ingredients, and instructions.

### 4.1 Use-Case Realizations
For two of these use cases, Use-Case Realization Specifications (UCRS) have been created
to provide deeper insights into their implementation:
- [Navigate through recipe](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UCRS/UCRS_NavigateThroughRecipe.md)
- [Show recipe](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/UCRS/UCRS_ShowRecipe.md)

## 5. Logical View
The MAUI frontend interacts with various services provided by the application logic
to implement the core functionality of Rezeptbuch.
These services manage tasks such as recipe retrieval, filtering and synchronization,
ensuring a clean separation between the user interface and the backend logic.

The following diagram illustrates the class structure of the application logic:

## 6. Process View
The Process View illustrates the runtime interactions between the system's components during key operations.
Below are the component-level sequence diagrams for core processes:

1. Show Recipe:  
Demonstrates how the system retrieves and displays detailed information about a specific recipe.  
![Show Recipe Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/sequence_diagrams/ShowRecipeSequenceDiagram.png)

2. Navigate Through Recipe:  
Visualizes the step-by-step process of navigating a recipe.  
![Navigate Through Recipe Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/GermanJesus-lul/Rezeptbuch/blob/main/docs/sequence_diagrams/NavigateThroughRecipeSequenceDiagram.png)

3. List Local Recipes:  
Shows how the system fetches locally saved recipes.

4. List Online Recipes:  
Depicts the process of retrieving recipes from the server.

## 7. Deployment View
The Rezeptbuch application is deployed as a native executable (.exe and MacOS counterpart) built using .NET MAUI and includes:
- The frontend UI rendered with MAUI.
- A local database for offline access.
- XML-based recipe files stored on disk.

The backend API is deployed separately using Render and accessed via RESTful HTTP.
It makes use of a database which is also hosted by Render.
The frontend and application logic communicate with the server to upload, update, and retrieve online recipes.

No web server or cloud deployment is required for the local application itself, enabling simple distribution and offline functionality.

## 8. Implementation View
### 8.1 Overview
The Rezeptbuch implementation model is organized into three main layers:
1. **Frontend**:  
   Handles user interaction and presentation
2. **Application Logic**:  
   Serves as the core of the application, managing workflows (e.g., startup logic, recipe handling) and acting as the intermediary between the Frontend and API layers.
3. **API (Server)**:  
   Provides the online service for recipe storage, retrieval and listing.

### 8.2 Layers
The following package diagram illustrates the organization of the Rezeptbuch implementation model into three main layers:
Frontend, Application Logic, and API (Server), highlighting the dependencies and interactions between these layers.

## 9. Data View
Rezeptbuch stores recipe data in two forms: structured entries in a local SQLite database and full recipe content in XML files.
The database holds metadata such as titles, categories, and ingredient references, which enables fast searching and filtering.
The XML files contain the complete recipe information and are used for display, editing, and syncing.

The data model supports linking recipes with categories and ingredients through mapping tables.
Data consistency is ensured using hashes, and the design allows recipes to be added, modified, or removed without affecting the overall structure.

## 10. Size and Performance
The Rezeptbuch application is lightweight and optimized for responsiveness.
Recipe data is stored as compact XML files alongside a local SQLite database.
The system is designed to handle a large number of recipes without significant performance issues.

Recipe lists load quickly both locally and from the server.
Hash calculations and file parsing are efficient, and startup synchronization is implemented to minimize delays.
Performance is considered throughout the development process using TDD and profiling where needed.

## 11. Quality
The architecture of Rezeptbuch is designed to support key quality attributes:  
- **Performance**:  
Local recipe lists load in under 0.5 seconds and online recipes in under 1.5 seconds, achieved through optimized data retrieval mechanisms.
- **Testability**:  
Test-Driven Development (TDD) ensures high code quality, supported by mocking frameworks for effective testing of isolated components.
- **Maintainability**:  
The modular codebase follows principles like Dependency Injection (DI), Open-Closed-Principle (OCP) and Single-Responsibility-Principle (SRP), enabling straightforward updates and feature integration.
- **Usability**:  
The intuitive UI requires no formal training, with consistent UX patterns ensuring ease of use for all users.
- **Security**:  
Data integrity is safeguarded using hashes during syncing.
- **Availability**:  
Offline access is supported through local storage and database synchronization, allowing uninterrupted usage.
- **Scalability**:  
Designed to handle up to 1 million recipes.  

This design ensures the system is robust, user-friendly, and adaptable to future needs.
